I have analyzed the code and prepared a plan to implement your request.

### **Plan: White Background & Collapsible Banner**

1.  **Pure White Background (`public/portal.html`)**
    *   **CSS Update:** Change the `.portal-banner` background from the current blue/green gradient to **pure white (`#ffffff`)**.
    *   **Remove Overlay:** Disable the gradient overlay (`::after` pseudo-element) so the white background is not tinted or shadowed.

2.  **Collapse Banner if Not Set (`public/portal.html` & `public/admin.html`)**
    *   **Logic Update:** Modify the portal's initialization script to check if the banner height is set to `0`. If so, it will apply `display: none` to the banner container, causing it to collapse completely and let other elements occupy the space.
    *   **Admin Interface:** Update the "Banner Height" input in the Admin Portal to allow a value of `0` (currently minimum is 50px) and update the label to indicate "Set to 0 to hide".

### **Outcome**
*   **With Banner:** The banner area will have a clean white background behind your image.
*   **Without Banner:** If you set the height to `0` in settings, the banner area will disappear entirely, shifting the content up.
