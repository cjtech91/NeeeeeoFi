I will modify `src/services/licenseService.js` to include the full response body in the error message when activation fails. This will reveal exactly what the external server is returning (e.g., if the JSON structure is different than expected, such as using `status: "success"` instead of `success: true`, or if it's returning a specific error message in a different field).

**Detailed Plan:**

1. **Update** **`licenseService.js`**:

   * Modify the `activateLicense` method.

   * In the `else` block (when `response.success` is false), construct a detailed error message.

   * Include `response.message`, `response.msg`, or the stringified `response` object itself in the error.

   * This ensures that the alert shown to the user in the Admin Dashboard contains the actual server response, enabling us to debug the "Status: 200" issue.

2. **Verify**:
