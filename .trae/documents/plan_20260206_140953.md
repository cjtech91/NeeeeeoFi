I will confirm the system's readiness for activation and its simulation status.

### **Analysis Findings**

1.  **License Activation:**
    *   **Yes**, the system is designed to use the token provided by the URL.
    *   When you click "Activate", the system sends your Key and HWID to your server (`https://neofisystem.com/...`).
    *   Your server is expected to return a JSON object containing a signed `token` and `signature`.
    *   The system saves this token locally (`data/license.json`) and uses it to unlock features.
    *   **Action:** No code changes needed for this logic; it is already correctly implemented in `LicenseService.js`.

2.  **Simulation Mode:**
    *   **Confirmed:** The system is currently running in **Simulation Mode** because it is on Windows.
    *   **Evidence:** `HardwareService.js` detects `process.platform === 'win32'` and:
        *   Mocks GPIO (Relays) instead of crashing.
        *   Returns "Windows Dev Environment" as the device model.
        *   Generates fake CPU temperature data.
    *   **Impact:** This is perfect for testing the license logic safely without needing a real Raspberry Pi.

### **Plan**
Since the code is already correct based on your question, no file edits are required. I will simply explain how the activation flow works so you can verify your server-side API response structure.

**Expected API Response from your Server:**
Your PHP script (`endpoint=activate`) must return JSON in this format for the system to accept it:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": {
    "hwid": "0d9b...",
    "type": "full",
    "owner": "Customer Name",
    "expires": "No Expiration"
  },
  "signature": "BASE64_SIGNATURE_STRING"
}
```
*The `signature` must be created using the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key stored in `config/license_public.pem`.*
