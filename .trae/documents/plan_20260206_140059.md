I will update the license activation logic to communicate with your new HTTPS endpoint and include the required device information.

### **Plan of Action**

1. **Update** **`src/services/licenseService.js`**

   * **Add HTTPS Support:** Import the `https` module to handle secure connections to `neofisystem.com`.

   * **Update API URL:** Change the default `apiUrl` to `https://neofisystem.com/api/index.php?endpoint=activate`.

   * **Modify Activation Logic (`activateLicense`):**

     * Update the payload to include `device_model: this.deviceModel` along with `key` and `hwid`.

     * Remove the automatic `/activate` path appending, so it uses the exact URL provided.

     * Implement protocol detection to switch between `http` and `https` automatically based on the URL.

### **Verification**

* **Payload Check:** The system will send a JSON body like:

  ```json
  {
    "key": "NEO-...",
    "hwid": "0d9b...",
    "device_model": "Raspberry Pi 4"
  }
  ```

* **Endpoint:** The request will go to `https://neofisystem.com/api/index.php?endpoint=activate`.
